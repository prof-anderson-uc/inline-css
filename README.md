## What Is Inline CSS?

Inline CSS refers to styles added **directly inside an HTML tag** using the `style` **attribute**.


>
> **What is an Attribute?**  
> In HTML, an **attribute** provides additional information about an element.  
> Attributes are written inside the opening tag and follow this format:  
> 
> ```html
> <tag attribute="value">Content</tag>
> ```
> 
> The `style` attribute is just one of many you’ll see in HTML (others include `href`, `src`, `alt`, and `class`).<br>

## Example Inline CSS
```html
<h2 style="color: purple;">This text is purple.</h2>
```



## Strengths of Inline CSS
- Quick and easy for small, one-off changes.

- No separate CSS file needed—works in limited platforms like Canvas or email editors.

- Overrides styles from external and internal stylesheets.

- Great for prototyping and experimenting with visual changes.

## Weaknesses of Inline CSS
- Not scalable—each element must be styled individually.

- Hard to maintain—clutters HTML and mixes content with design.

- No advanced features like media queries, pseudo-classes, or variables.

- Code duplication if you apply the same styles in multiple places.



## CSS Properties to Try
Here are some properties you might apply with the style attribute:

- color

- background-color

- font-size

- text-align

- padding

- border

- list-style-type
