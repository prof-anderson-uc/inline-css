# üêæ Inline CSS Exercise: Style Apollo the Cat

In this activity, you'll practice applying **inline CSS styles** using the `style` attribute inside HTML tags, just like you would in a platform like Canvas or WordPress.

You'll be styling a mini web page all about **Apollo**, a gloriously fluffy British Shorthair cat who just happens to be a social media star... and the grandfather of my cat Vladimir.

## Exercise Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Apply CSS styles using the `style` HTML attribute.
- Navigate between the **Visual** and **HTML (code)** views in Canvas‚Äôs text editor.
- Use basic CSS properties like `color`, `background-color`, `padding`, `font-size`, `border`, and `width`.
- Understand the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS.

## What Is Inline CSS?

Inline CSS refers to styles added **directly inside an HTML tag** using the `style` attribute.

```html
<p style="color: darkblue;">This paragraph is styled using inline CSS.</p>
```

This method is useful when you're:

- Working in a content editor like Canvas, WordPress, or email.
- Making quick, targeted changes without access to a full stylesheet.
- Prototyping or learning how styles affect elements in real-time.

## What Is an Attribute?

In HTML, an **attribute** gives extra information about an element.  
Attributes appear in the **opening tag** and follow this format:

```html
<tag attribute="value">Content</tag>
```

The `style` attribute is just one of many‚Äîothers include `href`, `src`, `alt`, and `class`.

## Inline CSS: Strengths vs. Weaknesses

### ‚úÖ Strengths

- Simple and direct. Good for short snippets or content management platforms like Canvas or WordPress.

- No need to write a separate CSS file.

- Great for learning, prototyping, or quick design changes.

- Can override external or internal styles.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Not scalable. All styles must be repeated on every element and don't benefit from the cascade or inheritance.

- Makes your HTML cluttered and harder to maintain.

- Doesn't support advanced CSS features like grid/flex, pseudo-classes, or media queries.

## What You'll Do

1. Start with a plain HTML file about Apollo (provided).
2. Choose an image of Apollo and add it to your post.
3. Follow along as I demonstrate how to add `style` attributes to tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<section>`, `<ol>`, and more.
4. Use CSS properties such as:

   - `color`, `font-family`, `text-align`  
   - `padding`, `margin`, `line-height`  
   - `width`, `border`, `background-color`  
   - `max-width`, `float`, `list-style-type`

5. Make your layout visually appealing and well-spaced.
6. At the bottom of the file, complete the **final challenge**.

## Final Style Challenge

Near the bottom of the code, you‚Äôll see this:

```html
<blockquote>
   ‚ÄúFollow your dreams... and always look fluffy doing it.‚Äù
   <cite>‚Äî Apollo</cite>
</blockquote>
```

Your job:  
Use the `style` attribute to style this quote however you want. Try playing with:

- Font styles
- Alignment
- Colors
- Spacing
- Anything else that feels expressive
